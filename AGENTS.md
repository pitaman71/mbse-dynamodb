# Guide for AI agents

An in-memory store journaled to DynamoDB, each committed transaction a journal entry, with occasional snapshots (mbse-basis FEA-006, CAP-013). Python, in `python3/mbse/Persistence/DynamoDB` (`mbse.Persistence.DynamoDB`).

## Invariants

- **Use mbse-schemas as it stands.** A gap found is reported to the user, not worked around here.
- **Siblings are checkouts beside this repository**, pinned by commit in `siblings.json`. Other agents may be working
  in them: never edit a sibling from here.
- **What this repository builds is specified in mbse-basis' features and capabilities**
  (`../mbse-basis/docs/features/`, `../mbse-basis/docs/capabilities/`), by ID; cite those IDs, each introduced
  by bridge language (mbse-basis `docs/README.md`, Rules for writing items, "Bridge, don't duplicate").
- **Tests run with pytest** from `python3/`: `uv sync && uv run pytest`. Use uv, never pip.
- **It implements mbse-rest's persistence plugin**, `mbse.Services.Rest.Persistence.Plugin` (`load`, `journal`,
  `snapshot`), as `mbse/Persistence/DynamoDB/Plugin.py`; mbse-rest's `docs/CONTRACT.md` (Persistence) is the contract
  and `Persistence.Memory` the reference it must agree with. mbse-rest is a sibling checkout, pinned in `siblings.json`.

## Working agreement (M0, for every agent on mbse-rest, mbse-dynamodb, mbse-react and mbse-demo-apps)

- Work on a branch in each repository you change (M0's is `m0-contract`). Commit and push after every step whose
  tests pass (`git push -u origin <branch>`, or `python3 ../mbse-basis/scripts/polyrepo.py push` where it supports
  every sibling). Never commit to `main`. When done, open one pull request per repository with `gh pr create`,
  listing the decisions for review.
- Where the capabilities are silent, take the simplest default consistent with them and with mbse-schemas, record it
  under "Decided by the agent, for review" (for the REST contract, in mbse-rest's `docs/CONTRACT.md`, from mbse-rest's
  own work; otherwise in this repository's docs), and keep going.
- Stop and report (do not work around) for: a gap or bug in mbse-schemas; an outward-facing action beyond pushing
  branches and opening pull requests in these repositories; anything destructive (force-push, deleting branches or
  files outside your work, rewriting history); a contradiction in a capability that changes what gets built.
- Never edit a sibling from another repository's work; never edit mbse-schemas or mbse-basis.
- Never write to `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` or any hidden memory: what is worth keeping goes in the repository.
- Conventions: Python with uv (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`), never pip; package capitalization as mbse-schemas has it
  (`mbse.Services.Rest`); "property", never "field", and "schema", never "type", for schema-governed things. Models
  as data are written in the builders' fluent syntax, never wire format, never helpers that wrap builder syntax.
- End every commit message with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`, and every pull request's
  description with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
